        Pope Francis emphasized that armed forces should act solely for
        legitimate defense and always respect international laws. He reiterated
        that military service should ensure the security and freedom of people
        and never impose dominion over other nations. He called for peace in
        various conflict zones, including Ukraine, the Middle East, Myanmar, and
        Sudan, urging the international community to work towards resolving
        these conflicts and to promote dialogue and reconciliation.
