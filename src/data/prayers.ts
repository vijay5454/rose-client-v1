      "I believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord. He was conceived by the Holy Spirit, and born of the Virgin Mary. He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried. He descended into hell. On the third day He rose again. He ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty. He will come again to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting.",

      "<strong>FOR RESIGNATION TO GOD'S WILL</strong><br/> Great Saint Joseph, to whose will the Savior subjected Himself, obtain for me the grace to subject myself in all things to the Will of God. Through the merits you obtained when in the darkness of night you obeyed the commands of the angel without any objection, obtain for me, that nothing may detain me from fulfilling the Will of God with complete resignation. In the stable and in the flight to Egypt, you recommended yourself and those dearest to you to Divine Providence; thus grant to me also the grace to resign myself to the Will of God in discouragement and despondence, in health and in sickness, in happiness and in misfortune. Obtain for me the grace that nothing may disturb my tranquility of soul with which I hope obediently to go the way of Divine Providence. Amen.<br/> <strong>FOR THE SANCTIFICATION OF OUR LABOR</strong><br/> Glorious Saint Joseph, model of all who are devoted to labor, obtain for me the grace to work in the spirit of penance for the expiation of my many sins and to work faithfully by placing the love of duty above my own desires. Help me to work with gratitude and joy. Let me consider it an honor to use and develop by labor the gifts received from God. Aid me to work with order, peace, moderation and patience, without ever avoiding weariness and trials. Help me to work, above all, for the glory of God and not for any selfish reason; and always to keep before my eyes not only death but also the account I must give of time lost, of talents wasted, of good omitted, and of pride in success, so baneful to the work of God. All for Jesus, all through Mary, all after your example, O Patriarch Joseph! This will be my motto in life and in death. Amen. (St. Pius X)<br/> <strong>FOR THE CONVERSION OF A SINNER</strong><br/> Joseph most just, I earnestly commend to you the salvation of a soul dear to me and redeemed by Jesus through the shedding of His Blood. Great Saint, you know how unhappy are those who have banished the Savior from their heart, and how direly exposed these sinners are to eternal loss. I beg of you therefore to beckon this wayward soul away from the path of perdition. Enlighten this sinner, speak a forceful language to his heart; call back this prodigal son to his father's embrace. Do not desist from your urgings till finally you have opened for him the gates of heaven, where he shall bless you everlastingly for the bliss to which you will have led him. Amen.",
