        The Apostle's Creed:
      </h2>
      <p>
        I believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and
        in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord. He was conceived by the Holy
        Spirit, and born of the Virgin Mary. He suffered under Pontius Pilate,
        was crucified, died and was buried. He descended into hell. On the third
        day He rose again. He ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right
        hand of God the Father Almighty. He will come again to judge the living
        and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church,
        the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of
        the body, and life everlasting.
        <p className="mt-2">Amen.</p>

        The Lord's Prayer -(Our Father)
      </h2>
      <p>
        Our Father, Who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come,
        Thy Will be done, On earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day Our
        daily bread, and Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who
        trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us
        from evil.
